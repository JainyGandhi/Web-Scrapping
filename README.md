## Introduction

Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. This project is a simple example of how to use Selenium for web scraping in Python. The target website is a simple quotes website that allows us to extract quotes, authors, and tags.

## Features

- Automates the browser using Selenium WebDriver.
- Scrapes quotes, authors, and tags from the target website.
- Saves the extracted data into an Excel file (`quotes_data.xlsx`).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Google Chrome installed.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-selenium.git
   cd web-scraping-selenium
2. The required packages include:

selenium
webdriver-manager
pandas

3. Set up ChromeDriver:

The project automatically installs and manages ChromeDriver using webdriver-manager. This ensures compatibility between your Chrome browser and the ChromeDriver.

Usage
1. Run the script:

After setting up the environment, you can run the script to start the web scraping process:
